FORTIFYIQ. INC. FREE USE LICENSE TERMS

By exercising the Licensed Rights, you accept and agree to be bound
by the terms and conditions of this "Free Use License" (hereinafter,
"License"). You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of
your acceptance of these terms and conditions.

    1. License grant: Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Free Use License, the Licensor hereby grants you a worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable
    license to exercise the Licensed soft macro, FIQ-OpenAES-128e,
	including the rights to use	and/or redistribute and/or modify 
	the soft macro or parts of the 	soft macro for non-commercial 
	use only, and not for commercial use or resale.

    (a) Non-commercial, as used herein, means use not primarily
    intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or
    monetary compensation. 

    (b) Where exceptions and limitations apply to your use, this
    License, and the terms and conditions therein, will not apply to
    the extent of those exceptions and limitations.

    2. If this soft macro or parts are used as part of a new soft macro,
    you must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
    to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
    therefore apply, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.

    3. You may expand this license by your own license. In this case
    this license still applies to the soft macro as described in
    sections 1 and 2 and must not be changed. The expansion by your
    license must be clearly recognizable as such. In any case of
    conflict between the license and the expansion by your license,
    the License shall prevail over the expansion by your license.

    4. If this soft macro or parts are used as part of a new soft macro,
    you must provide equivalent access to the source soft macro of the
    entire work, as a whole, to anyone who comes into possession of a
    copy, in the same manner as for the binary version, and at no
    charge.

    5. Other Rights: 

    (a) Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
    License. 

    (b) Moral rights  are not licensed under this License nor are
    publicity, privacy, and/or other similar rights; however, to the
    extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
    any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent
    necessary to allow you to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not
    otherwise. 

    (c) While the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from
    you for the exercise of the Rights hereunder, the Licensor
    expressly reserves the right to collect royalties for
    non-permitted uses, including commercial use or resale.
